SIMPLE ACTIONS

1. The user enters a number they want converted into an EditText
2. They change the spinner to the unit of measure to convert from
3. The other conversion types all show their measuremnet version of that unit amount

1. Create the layout in activity_main.xml
	a. Use relative layout for a label "Conver From", EditText and Spinner
	b. Use Grid Layout for bottom that contains 2 columns and 6 rows
	c. Make gridLayout a blue color
	d. Use the units teaspoons, tablespoons, cup, ounces, pints, quarts, gallons, pounds, milliliter, liter, milligram, kilograms
	

2. Setup MainActivity
	a.Initialize Spinner, EditText, and all TextViews
	b. In onCreate
		I. Add items to Spinner

		ii. Define layout to use with Spinner
		iii. Connect Adapter to Spinner
		II. Add Listener to Spinner
		i. Use setOnItemSelectedListener for Spinner
		ii. NOTE: Maybe check of I'll use base class for unit conversion (everything becomes a teaspoon, then converted to other measurement)
		III. Get val from EditTxt
		IV. Initialize TextViews
	c. End onCreate-----------------
3. Define a Quantity Class ------------
a. Quantity class contains a value and Unit enum
b. Define an enum for each unit type
c. Get the conversion for each unit type from teasponn which is the base unit
d. Receive the nnumber of teaspoons for starting unit
e. convert to base unit teaspoons, divide by base unit
f. convert to another unit to teaspoon, mult by base
g. constructor to receive
h. create toString that prints val & unit type

4. Finish MainActivity
